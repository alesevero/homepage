            <p>There is no such thing as engineering without
              business. Having worked in large and small
              companies, I am able to learn and understand
              business in a fast-paced rhythm, being able to
              deliver high-grade software that fullfils the

              design thinking sessions, researches, build
              high and low-fidelity prototypes, as well do
              testing and validation of a product. All of
